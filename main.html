	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity measures how the running time of an algorithm changes as the input size increases. It helps determine how efficient an algorithm is in solving a problem. Lower time complexity means the algorithm runs faster and uses fewer resources. For example, an algorithm with O(n) time complexity grows linearly with input size, while O(1) is the most efficient as it takes constant time regardless of input size.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures how much memory an algorithm uses as the input size grows. It shows how efficient the algorithm is in terms of memory usage.
Example: O(n) means the memory used increases linearly with the input size.</p>

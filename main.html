	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity Explained</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Time complexity</strong> measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows with input size; it helps us judge how <em>efficient</em> an algorithm is and choose better approaches for large inputs.
  </p>

  <p>
    In contrast, <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs. For example, an algorithm that stores results for every input element typically has O(n) space complexity, meaning memory grows linearly with input size.
